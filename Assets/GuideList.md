**Shepherd** | King-size cruiser with better fire rates on defensive and offensive weapons. Named after wool farmers, for some reason.

**TasDevil** | Broken demon from down under with shield boost. Built like a brick waste-disposal shelter.

**TekGnosis** | Mountain-sized UAC juggernaut. Once built, any structure shall not be destroyed. May devs have mercy on your core.

**Trident** | General purpose cruiser with faster build rates for all tactical buildings.

**Yeti** | Enormous Antarctic ice-breaker, re-purposed as a fully-functional battlecruiser. Houses the Compensator-107 drone overclocker, for a cheaper workforce.
